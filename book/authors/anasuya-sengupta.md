[^1]: These are names of journalists/writers/Internet activists from different
parts of the world who have been harassed, imprisoned, or disappeared by their
governments in the past few years. This list of names is obviously not meant
to be either comprehensive, or representative; it invokes poetic license to
remind us of what – and who – is at stake.
