Freedom of information, much like freedom of markets, doesn’t
“naturally” lead to the kind of freedom we hope for in society. In
fact, in the past decade since the rise of the free culture movement,
we’ve seen many costs such as time, attention and education shifting
to the side of content creators while financial profit is centralized
by the data-hoarding Internet giants that enjoy the reputation of
information liberators. Google, for example, is considered a great
patron for free culture, whereas in practice it cannibalizes the free
culture that it monetizes, offsetting the costs of culture from those
consuming it, and profiting from those creating it, and that's us.

The technological principle that powers digital freedom of
information, and that we celebrate through free culture and the
creative explosion of the web, is the same technological principle
that powers digital surveillance. We have to stop seeing these
technological principles as “ready-made for culture” whether that be
as a pre-made model for cultural exchange, or as a pre-made model for
the end of privacy. This techno-determinism is a double-edged sword;
it’s time to wake up and realize that the new possibilities and
challenges posed by digital networks should inform the way we decide
to live our lives, not dictate it.
