The future was to be excellent. Thanks to the endless progress of
human knowledge, technology would deliver the right solution at the
right time. As industrial powers scaled up, though, and hacked their
way out of diminishing returns with brute force, the picture of a
bright future turned out to be as naive and grotesque as the vision of
the year 2000 as seen from 1902.

Modernity is totalitarian. Following Descartes' proclamation of the
prevalence of the mind over matter, modern science engaged in a
process of stripping away uncertainty and contradiction. The world of
the mechanical clock was thoroughly explained, controlled, and made to
serve mankind, in accordance with the Biblical injunction of breeding
and multiplying, and using the God-given resources of the Earth. But
the world is not complicated: it's complex, and contradiction is
built-in.

Capitalism was a fantastic booster that propelled us from candle light
to LED, from parchment to digital computer, from horse carriage to
spacecraft. Its premises, though, require endless growth, and some
time would pass before we could replicate our own spaceship Earth. As
it attained global operational scale, capitalism was panting like a
hamster on its wheel ready for a heart attack. The myth of progress
was on artificial respiration. The capitalist system now reached
capacity and still requires new markets, better outcomes, more
efficient ways to suck fossil and mineral resources off the
ground. The system is ticking seamlessly: grab a piece of primary
rainforest, cut down the trees for construction and furniture, plant
soy to feed millions of pigs on thousands of farms, then when the soil
is sucked dead 5 years later, mine for minerals and frack for oil
shale.

We would already need to harvest the resources of four planets like
Earth to keep up with the pace at which the global industrial war
machine exploits and decays our environment. But we barely can send
robots to Mars, so this option is off. We could wait for the next
super-technology-that-will-save-us-all, but as Jevons observed, any
technological progress increases the efficiency of resource use,
consumption of resources rise as more demand is met. If a new engine
can be made more cheaply, it will sell more, and the net result will
be a faster and stronger pressure on resources. Even if such
super-technology could potentially appear, it remains a big IF, and
would it come in time for us to reverse the damage already done to the
fragile conditions that maintain the Earth livable for our species?

An obvious course of action would be to stop running and relinquish a
bit of comfort to bring about the possibility of our survival. This
solution, though, requires the end of growth, which fundamentally
contradicts the extraction system that fueled the technological boom
in the last two centuries. Given the importance, in terms of scale, of
the problematic at hand, the possibility of a peaceful solution
remains both remote and indispensable. Other paths can only amplify
the crisis and lead to catastrophe.

Thought, here, has reached its limits: only action remains
possible. Mindful, ethical, and compassionate action. Loving, caring,
and sensible action may unlock the true potential of a successful
humanity, and freedom, yet undefined, remains a golden key.
