_This essay is adapted from one originally published on my personal
website, [missbananabiker.com][missbananabiker.com]._

I publish my work under my full name. I write about my life without
holding back, except where innocent people might be harmed as a result
of my writing about them.

You might wonder why I advocate so passionately for internet privacy
when I tell the whole world all my secrets without restraint, when I
am completely open about, for instance, being an abuse survivor who is
this year celebrating my twentieth year of freedom.

1. I have always had the option of keeping my secrets. For years,
while I was being abused, I was forced to keep secrets, and then I
continued to do so because I was afraid of people’s reactions to
hearing about what I had survived.

I personally don’t care any more if you think I’m a weirdo because I
am a weirdo, and I’m fine with that. In fact, my weirdness is what I
have to offer the world.

2. So my weirdness and my truth are things I talk about because it’s
what I have to contribute, and because I’m tired of the forced silence
which isolated me.

Now I want to exercise my own free speech. I want to tell people about
my experiences. I hope that maybe some of you will get ideas from all
this for how to spark change in your own worlds, even if all you do is
teach your kids that they have the right to establish firm
boundaries. Particularly firm physical boundaries, like getting to
decide who to hug and when.

3. But privacy is important. I have the right to be a private person
if I choose to do so, and for about eighteen years I did choose to do
so. I did that for my own safety. I have a right to preserve my own
safety.

4. When it comes to the state spying on me, I admit I don’t have much
“to hide.” There are things I would be a little embarrassed to know
about if you learned them, but for me personally at this moment in
time, concentrated state surveillance is not my biggest fear.

5. I personally am more afraid of all the trackers from Facebook and
Amazon and other companies with which I do business. And that’s why I
flush my cookies with the frequency of a true paranoiac and use all
sorts of browser extensions to protect myself to whatever degree I
can.

6. But there are people, a lot of people, who have a genuine reason to
fear state surveillance. I could easily be one of them. And I think
it’s important that you all read, for instance, about a really gross
spying bill called CISA that passed the US Senate with only twenty-one
votes against it. We are not fighting this spying. We are letting it
happen.

7. Here’s what Edward Snowden has to say about that bill: “What it
allows is for the companies you interact with every day – visibly,
like Facebook, or invisibly, like AT&T – to indiscriminately share
private records about your interactions and activities with the
government.” Actually, the bill *requires* those companies to share
your info with the NSA. Seriously.

8. Now you understand maybe why I am paranoid about my business-facing
cookies.

9. If the government spies on citizens without our consent, without
our knowledge, without valid reason, we all lose something
precious. We lose the right to be flawed people. We all become
criminals by default.

10. As an abuse survivor, I’ve lived under circumstances like that,
where every move was monitored. And I have to tell you, living under a
microscope is definitely not being free. When you have to account for
every hour of your day to your abusive father, when you have to find
places to hide contraband items like rock music cassettes, when you
have to keep secrets as a matter of survival, you are not free.

As a former preacher’s daughter, I can tell you that I’ve also lived
in a fishbowl, and fishbowls are not free places either.  When your
whole church discusses whether your parents are being profligate with
their money by taking their thirteen-year-old daughter whose
classmates call her "Bugs Bunny" to an orthodontist, that's not
freedom.

11. As an army brat, I was raised to believe that the US government is
some sort of heroic institution that exports freedom and democracy to
the rest of the world. The first lessons I learned in my US Department
of Defense school were about freedom and its importance.

12. Partly because I am an abuse survivor, I value justice. It’s just
super important to me that people be treated fairly and humanely and
that their basic rights be respected.

13. I have always wanted the United States to be a nation that values
freedom. I have always thought that the most important line ever
written by our founding fathers was not in the Constitution but in the
Declaration of Independence: “...that all men are created equal, that
they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights,
that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”

14. With the spying, our government and others are taking our liberty
and chilling our pursuit of happiness. By spying on us, they’ve put us
in a position where we are constantly trying to cover our tracks. Even
flushing your cookies is evidence you’re suffering from a chilling
effect. You shouldn’t have to cover your tracks unless you’re hiding
from something.

15. This is also why you should be very, very worried about treaties
like TPP, TTIP, and TiSA. The aforementioned spying bill, CISA, lays
some of the groundwork in the US for those treaties, helps foster an
environment that would allow the American government — and, with the
treaties, corporations and governments around the world — to encroach
on everyone's liberties even more.

16. As someone who has survived tyranny, the most important thing to
me is never living under it again. As someone who is free with my
opinions, it’s important to me that I have the right to be free with
my opinions.

17. Internet freedom is a women’s issue. Have you read the 1972
Johnnie Tillmon piece from Ms. magazine, Welfare is a Women’s Issue ?
You should. It explains why access to food and shelter are vitally
important to women.

18. Internet privacy is also vitally important to women. If your
abusive partner has installed a keystroke logger on your computer, you
have no freedom of association, expression or movement. To leave such
a partner, a person would need to get to a computer at a public
library or internet cafe, establish an anonymous identity, make
private phone calls and check-in to a safe location without being
tracked. The effect of one partner spying on another can be absolutely
devastating, and the ability to escape such spying is crucial to
survival.

We need these tools to survive situations like the one above,
situations which are all too common. People who want to make strong
cryptography illegal, like FBI Director James Comey, are saying they
don't want us to have the tools we need to in order to escape
life-threatening situations. That's not just misguided; it's
tyrannical and frightening. Comey is behaving like an abusive partner,
trying to make some rule that you aren't allowed to stop him from
reading all your emails and text messages. He and people like him are
trying to make it illegal for people like me to survive this world.

19. The government and some of the bigger corporations have basically
installed keystroke loggers on us, except they’ve done it in tricky
ways we don’t discover until after our privacy has already been
compromised.

20. Edward Snowden recently said on Twitter, “Surveillance is not
about safety. It’s about power. It’s about control.”

You could replace the word “surveillance” with “abuse” and you’d have
the same statement. This is why a free Internet is so important to
me. This is why the right to privacy is so fundamental in my
opinion. Because we all deserve to be free from those who would hold
us captive, whether those folks are abusers or stalkers or just the
good people who’ve built a surveillance apparatus that makes the Stasi
look like amateur hour.

We all deserve that freedom. Anyone who is a survivor should value
that freedom, and anyone who has suffered oppression should viscerally
understand why, and anyone who is human should do whatever they can to
protect that freedom.
