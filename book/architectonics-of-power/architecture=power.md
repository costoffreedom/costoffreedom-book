> _Je ne bâtis que pierres vives ce sont des hommes._
  <br>I only build with living stones, those are men.
  <br>--Rabelais, French humanist (1494-1553)

The Code of Hammurabi, a basalt stone covered with cuneiform script,
preserved at Le Louvre in Paris, is recognized as an important
artifact for both art and history. Erected by the King of Babylon,
Hammurabi, "protector of the weak and oppressed" circa 1792–1750 BC,
the Code is the most complete legal compendium of Antiquity, written
even before the Biblical laws. Emblematic of the Mesopotamian
civilization, the stone embodied the Law into a single, indivisible
object.

On rocks, monuments, or in city topologies, societies through the ages
have inscribed their rules into architecture. Today, we no longer
engrave laws onto stone, but architecture remains powerful at a
symbolic level. ISIS, as a recent example, is destroying ancient
temples in Palmyra and elsewhere in the Cradle of Humanity, because
they recognize its representation of older culture. By desecrating
these old monuments and broadcasting their destruction online, ISIS
wants to show the world that it is destroying the memory of a period
before the Prophet, and deleting the cultural symbols of Bashar Al
Assad’s power, making way for their new Caliphate.

Whether a smooth basalt stone, a Hindu temple, the Eiffel Tower, the
pentagon, the Twin Towers, or your own house, architecture is always
the manifestation of a system. A signifier of values, it contains a
will to express the inherent power it represents. Building or
destroying architecture is a mechanism for power to send a strong
message to its audience.

Digital tools now allow further options. They can express the
willingness to rebuild, and to oppose brutality with creativity; not
with real stone, but with people that are the “living stones” of
Rabelais.

The #NEWPALMYRA project is at the cutting-edge of this international
movement. Born out of the emergency of the Syrian crisis, the
#NEWPALMYRA project is an online community platform and data
repository dedicated to the capture, preservation, sharing, and
creative reuse of data about the ancient city of Palmyra.

In this project, the power engaged is the power of people to channel
their outrage and create hope through action. Aiming to virtually
reconstruct Palmyra’s cultural heritage, gathering data and knowledge,
#NEWPALMYRA is an expression of a collective consciousness.

People often make an opposition between the digital and the reqal but
it is a pointless statement: the digital should be considered as an
actualisation of real desire, as a space-and-time singularity where
everything and everyone (even the dead and the missing) can be a
presence for someone else.

We are now living in a world where the digital is omnipresent, and
where power is embodied in virtual and intangible architectures, and
code still comes from stone: computers are produced from geological
sources such as quartz or coltan.

This so-called virtual place is made out of real materials and is
based on infrastructures, such as data centers, embedded in our
ecology. The Internet and all complex information systems are real
architectures, and so are also an expression of power: their structure
is not pre-existent, but created intentionally by their designers.

We are all evolving a world made of digital and spatial layers, where
technologies are now able to follow and record our traces. The German
architect Jürgen Mayer H. has expressed this contemporary double
effect in his work, documenting where inhabitants leave traces of
their presence over the ground and walls as they pass. According to
Mayer H., “there is no such thing as a naive or innocent surface.”

Archaeology is the science of identifying and studying ancient traces
now preserved in ground or wall, to understand what or who left them
in their present time.

In the network, we are living in the traces we leave in our everyday
lives, using social media, producing or sharing content, taking
pictures or being tagged by others, having a real-time narrative
approach to our lives, valuing our past and accomplishments,
confessing to all our followers or stalkers what we were, are, and
want to be with words or metrics, and in which kind of world we wish
to live.

In ancient times, the worst punishment that could ever be pronounced
over someone, even worse than death, was called Damnatio
Memoriae. This post-mortem sentence given to a public persona implied
that their name would be erased from all public monuments, and their
statues pulled down or destroyed so they would be forgotten by the
people over time. But, today, we cannot be forgotten or discreet
because of the constant traces we leave on the Internet.

The Internet era is the age of the Chiaroscuro, where shades of
intention coexist: the impossibility of being forgotten and the
craving for attention, the use of the same tool by some to preserve
the history of ancient Palmyra, while others use it to delete the past
and broadcast their terror and destruction; the desire, through
technology, for both individual empowerment and mass surveillance.

If navigation into the digital spaces is no longer naive and can be
used for surveillance, what about a system where the law could judge
your intentions as well as your actions? Could we be tracked and
trialed for moving freely within it?

This awful and highly complex current war is devastating Syria,
harming its cultural heritage, and persecuting its “living stones.”
What is happening there shows the international community that people
are being tracked for expressing their will for freedom, be it with
something as simple as a "like" on a Facebook Page, or more arduous,
such as founding an entire hackerspace.

This cruel reality has to sensitize us to the power of information
technology, that it can be used, like any tool, for good or evil. The
ancient Greeks were aware of the dual nature of the pharmakon: in a
coercive system, the way you live or the path you take is enough to
make you suspect, and those systems punish intentions and actions
equally because of their potential for disruption.

The other lesson we, in the “free world” (where we don’t have to be
afraid of being shot by a hidden sniper), have to learn, is that
liking a Facebook page, or founding a hackerspace, does not have the
same cost for people living under a different system than ours. For us
it’s just a social interaction, for others it’s a social action that
can have terrible effects on their lives or the lives of their loved
ones.

We have to find a way to move freely in our minds and within the
systemic information architecture for it to remain a tool that can
empower the people and not enable a few to reduce freedom, enact
personal censorship, or jail those they perceive as threats for their
oppressive systems.

Ancient Greek orators used to create mental and imaginary architecture
as mnemonic techniques, to remember their long speeches so they could
easily express their arguments in the Agora. Today, technology helps
us acquire knowledge, express our opinions, and remind us that freedom
is not something slight to be taken for granted.

We are all at risk if someone more powerful than us doesn’t want us to
move anymore, in the streets or on the network, so we all have to ask
ourselves: What is the price we have to pay to inhabit this new
architecture we are collectively building, and what do we have to do
to preserve our freedom within it?
