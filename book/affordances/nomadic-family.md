> The problem of the costs within the schizoid logic of our times concerns mostly _potestas_, the quantitative, not _potentia_, or incorporeal intensities." 
    --Rosi Braidotti, Nomadic Theory

The question of costs often translates into issues of scale and
scalability that are dominant in technological societies. The "scale
solutionism" starts from the desire to solve cost problems and ends in
hyper-control, restriction, dissociation and finally disaster
conducted by non-aware necropolitics, where the politics of death
systematically takes over the politics of life (Mbembe 2003),
increasing the costs of freedom. In such instances, when the state of
power constantly refers to a state of exception in order to overcome
the rule of preservation and the social limit, Achille Mbembe explains
that it seems figures of sovereignty develop a general concern that is
not the preservation of the commons and liveliness, but the spreading
of death and the material destruction of bodies and populations:
Bassel Khartabil is, unfortunately, a direct victim.

In this context, it is impossible to address the problem of costs
without transforming our relation to the existing system. Always
confronted with an impossible dilemma of sustainability, we need to
envision different ways to face this situation. While costs are most
often evaluated as a quantifiable asset, this quantification is mainly
calculated in regards to an actual neo-liberal vision of individual
self and proprietary systems. It seems crucial to envision different
avenues to overcome the cost issues, and define new criteria of cost
evaluation that could lead to re-thinking the free production
processes in a different organization scheme, resulting in the main
question: we should ask ourselves if the costs of freedom cannot be
addressed as a qualitative process rather than a quantitative one.

Practically, to enforce such a process, only the diversity of networks
can help secure our individual endeavors; therefore, the re-evaluation
of the cost of freedom should start from the premises of community and
collective approaches to production and network realization, which
support non-proprietary production and distribution of
information. Resulting from the contestation of the need to encompass
our work in active F/LOSS and open source developments, is the
necessity to situate our social connection and embodiment leading to
new contexts for such a production. Starting from an assertion of the
actual situation, we are looking at ways to think complexly with
regards to freedom issues, and explore how to co-synchronise so that
the relation that feeds our networks can exist despite actual power
issues.

A Foucauldian view of the actual context would present, coextensively
to the rise of power structures, the formulation of scientific
discourse as the cause of actual costly body politics. While modernity
has attached its project to a rational view of the world based on a
clear mind-body split that is exponentially growing along with
technological development, this disunion nurtures the dissociative
powers of capitalism. Despite all efforts to enforce a discourse
promoting technology as a substitute for human relation, it is,
however, certain that the posthuman does not map to the network, and
more specifically it appears that the proposed agenda of
dematerialisation and autonomous artificial intelligent networks is a
fantasmagorical construction (Hayles 2001). Therefore, it is from a
holistic perspective that the observation of the actual complexity
needs to be undertaken. In the context of a huge up-scaling of human
presence on earth and the growth of social control apparatus, can an
examination of relational complexity bring us towards social
sustainability, and what would be the sensitive approach that could
ground an exchange system, and lead it towards a sustainable
expansion?

A holistic setup would allow us to spare ourselves by leaving the
costs for freedom at the expense of the potestas while reacting in
diverse and unstructured networks, and at a molecular level to reach
full potentia. We are looking for ways to confront necropolitics and
trigger liveliness; in this context liveliness is to be thought as a
spiritual process that further constitutes the grounds for a different
politics. Indeed, a different approach to politics needs to be rooted
in the life of the spirit that is not afraid of death, and instead of
looking for substitutes and technological prosthesis, it fully assumes
death as a constituent of human relation and organisation while it
looks beyond the unitary vision of the self, to molecular
transformations as a way to synchronize to the world in a deeply
transformative process (Braidotti 2011).

In response to this statement, several issues need to be addressed
that would further ground the development of our community processes,
based on a long history and knowledge of existing knowledge. Some
affordances might lead to explore different relational setups that
would help to transpose the question of costs.

__TRANSMISSION__: While power relations build over cycles of crisis,
they seem to destroy reference points and instrumentalize history to
the service of immediate power relations. Indeed, it is clear that
technological breakthroughs importantly transform relational
processes, but contrary to what we once have thought, they do not
expose the processes of power. On another hand, critical discourses,
tools and concepts are developed through time, and they often are
sourced from fragile social structures, either isolated individuals or
community structures. As a consequence of this fragility, they most
often repeatedly deal with recurrent issues, while transmission lines
are broken, they each time face the need to develop a discourse and
solutions. It is important to intervene at community scale in the
process of transmission to create community genealogies and a history
of community movement through time. This would allow us to keep those
principles active during technological transitions. One of the
possibilities is to expose current technological communities to
existing social science and allow for transdisciplinarity and
politicization of the discourse. The project of hackerspaces
workshops, for example, inscribes itself into a transactional process
of transmission through a collective community context.

__BIOPOWER__: As it appears that sovereignty stands as a condition of
control, the question of the unicity of self, is again a transient
issue persisting across time and through technologies. Variations of
intensity characterize the thinking subject and are mostly
characterized at its boundaries; those variations set a relational
process independent from the view of a holistic body. They in
principle go far further than the limits of human species in setting
the potential of transformation into a process of becoming. According
to Rosi Braidotti, this denaturalization process is one of the effects
of technological progress in fields such as biogenetics where we
integrate different species in an inter-evolutionary process.

__TRANSFORMATION__: After a consciousness-rising process triggered by
the awareness of a state of dismay, it could be timely to consider,
observe and acknowledge a trans-species potential for knowledge
diversity leading to social sustainability. This process can be
thought as both individual and collective, implying both personal
mutation, and through collective support, a larger transformational
process. Being in the instant and acting from this perspective, and
responding to the trigger of the momentum is a way to reach the
acknowledgment of the possibility of instantaneous
transformation. Variations of codes, genres and modalities of
expression of the idea see transposition as a possible solution for
genetic transmutation and exchange.
