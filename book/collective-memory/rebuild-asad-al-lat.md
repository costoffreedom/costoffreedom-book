<p>Watching the news in Syria, bloodshed and destruction everywhere, we
have mixed feelings, fear for our parents and friends in the country
facing all these atrocities, and there’s nothing that we can do. The
scene of an ISIS member destroying Asad Al-Lat statue with a hammer
triggered it all, the statue of a lion protecting a deer, with an
ancient script on its left leg, saying that bloodshed is prohibited.</p>

<p>We can fight this particular crime, a crime against humanity, because
what they destroyed in Palmyra besides many other areas, is the
world’s heritage. They want these statues, this heritage, to disappear
forever, but we will make the memory of these statues reach every
corner in the world: this is how this project aims to resist
destruction and ignorance.</p>

<p>We will provide open source 3D models of as much as we can of the
Syrian statues, focusing on those that have been destroyed, so anyone
worldwide can download, 3D print or use them in their applications,
and eventually make an online museum to exhibit these 3D
replicas. This project cannot compensate for the loss of those
priceless masterpieces, but at least we can still keep them in the
memories of successive generations.</p>
